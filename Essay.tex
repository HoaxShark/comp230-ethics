	Popularised guidelines do exist for portraying suicide in the news\cite{world2017preventing}\cite{nepon2009media} and drama adaptations\cite{DramaGuidelines}. \vspace{5mm} %5mm vertical space
	
	The drama adaptation guidelines match best with a video game environment as both generally show fictional scenes. However due to the artistic style, interactivity and immersion of video games it would be best to form more specific industry guidelines.
