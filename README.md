# Ethics & Professionalism Essay Proposal

## Should guidelines be put in place for video game developers to follow when portraying suicide/depression.

Suicide and depression can be a delicate subject with over 6000 suicides taking place last year in the UK and Ireland alone. In 2014 19.7%
of over 16's in the UK showed symptoms of anxiety or depression. The stigma around mental health issues and suicide still exists, 
although it seems to be improving. This research paper would like to explore the idea that when video games
take the opportunity to use suicide as a mechanic or storytelling method, this could be used as a perfect chance to reach out and provide 
understanding and help to those
that may be effected by the scene. Another thing it will consider is the lack of restrictions on how video games are allowed to portray 
suicide itself. Should restrictions be put in place to follow more along the lines with other visual media, or would using these chances to
provide 
contacts and help be enough? By looking at these issues the paper hopes to outline general guidelines for developers to follow when 
creating video games portraying suicide and/or depression, with the end goal of improving support for mental illness.
